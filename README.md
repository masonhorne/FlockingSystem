# Flocking System

This project implements a flocking simulation inspired by Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm. The system simulates the behavior of agents (planets) that move in a coordinated manner, resembling planetary orbit.

## Features

- Configurable gravity for particles
- Configurable wind effects for particles
- Optional particle collision detection
- Configurable particle size and color
- Particle lifetime + fadeout animation
- Adjustable spawn rate
- Gravity well placement
- Custom model uploads as .obj files
- Configurable maximum speed for particles
